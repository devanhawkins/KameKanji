# KameKanji
My self-created Android app that uses the Android notification system to periodically send out flashcards. Currently used to send Japanese Kanji- (Chinese character) related flashcards.

V0.1 Initial upload. Not yet complete. App generate a 'flashcard' when either the ON/OFF button is toggled on, or when "New Card" button is pushed.
     Currently reading info from the "joyo_example.txt" file. This is the file used for testing. The "joyo_3.txt" file is the target file.
